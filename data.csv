Always available, offers perfect advice, the most calming man at a time when emotions can be running sky high. He offers no bull, straight to the point and just makes you feel at ease with whatever alleged criminal situation I’ve found myself in. I’ve had a few occasions where I’ve required Doonan McCaig and if David has not been available at the time of trial, there is no confusion that Ashley will be in control of my case who has been absolutely flawless in representing me. I honestly could not recommend them highly enough and to be honest it’s a shame that people are not educated enough in criminal law to realise that they deserve the best representation possible instead of having solicitors appointed to them who just do not have their defendants best interests in mind.",1698366025

The Immigration people finally contacted me and his opinions and advice turned out to be spot on. My only regret is that our country has sunk so low that our civil servants and their contractors regularly expose people of all nationalities to such stress. Luckily we have Simon and his team to turn to when the Government lets us down. As an aside if there is anyone out there who wishes to expose the maladies of the outsourced visa application centers please feel free to contact me.",1670498813

Gave the case to a NEW QC the DAY BEFORE the trial started who had no recollection of the evidence, statements and details of the case. Put his client on the stand with zero communication or preparation before hand, let his client know that they were doing so with 5 minutes interval beforehand. If you value your life or your family members DO NOT GO WITH THIS SOLICITOR OR HIS CO WORKERS. you would have a bigger chance winning if you represent yourself. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.",1694429670

Keith J Tuck Solicitors,Jordan,1,THE WORST!!! Solicitors I’ve ever had to deal with would recommend people represent themselves before using this solicitors. Communication is terrible each time I’ve been to the court (for the same case) I have had different representatives for each appearance. And each time the new rep came they had no idea about the case and not went over the notes or have done so very briefly and clearly don’t communicate enough with the other associates. Very unorganised and negligent in every aspect wish I had changed lawyers and saved myself the stress and uncertainty. Twice I was left I represented until the last minute or a few hours in the court room wondering what is going on if anyone was going to turn up. DO NOT USE THIS SOLICITOR,1676993009
Beltrami & Company Solicitors,Jonny Mcculloch,5,"I can't thank Craig enough for the amazing work he has done for me in the short space of time.  My case was an absolute nightmare, it had been ongoing since April 2020 and my old solicitor was absolute useless. Craig was very transparent from our first meeting and sat with me and my wife to go through all the evidence from start to finish. Something my old solicitor never did . Craig answered all questions and made me and my wife feel at ease.  This case had been adjourned five times previously but Craig not only stopped it from being adjourned again he got the case kicked out.  So after 3 years and 8 months I can now finally get on with my life without this hanging over my head and it's all down to Craig's fantastic work. I would definitely rate Craig as an exquisite professional who carries his job with pride on his shoulders and does right by his client.

Beltrami & Company Solicitors,Frances McMullan,1,"If I could leave no stars I would. Over £3,000 for a few letters and emails. Beltrami took on a case for our company and after 3 months we were in a worse position than we started out. The solicitor's repetitive advise was to 'Sit Back' as we watched our successful small business of 30 years go down the toilet. It states in their terms of business that they will bill you on a 4 week period. Do not fall for this. We never received an invoice for 12 weeks and they charged us at higher rates than we signed for. Apparently there was a change to the rates during the period of them being our solicitors which was never communicated or agreed by us. Lack of Knowledge in the field. The solicitor should have held her hands up that she was our her depth and was not able to assist with this case, but they would rather rob you blind!!!",1686661094

Neil Kilcoyne & Co Solicitors,Jonny Mcculloch,1,"Avoid using these bunch of cowboys  The reception staff have absolutely no manners or decorum when dealing with a client. Rude, obnoxious and very unhelpful.  Don't waste your time,  Neil kilcoyne was my solicitor and he was absolutely useless. He told me wrong information about the case, always seemed unprepared, disorganised and dis interested. He mutters and stutters in court in front of the judge and lacks confidence in his own ability as a solicitor.  My case went on for far too long than it needed and in the end I ended up changing solicitor. The new solicitor done more for me in four days than what Neil kilcoyne done for me in two years  Once again be warned:-  If you want someone who is a stuttering mess in front of the judge and will get your case adjourned so he can milk legal aid or your hard earned money out of you then go with this fraud of a solicitor",1703982573
Neil Kilcoyne & Co Solicitors,Mya Kelly,1,Withdrew from acting for me because I questioned why things had happened and why they weren't willing to advocate for my rights as a mother.

Neil Kilcoyne & Co Solicitors,Lori Doch,1,"This company was recommended by the Legal Aid Board as they apparently covered the work I required help with.  I couldn’t speak to any of the lawyers as speaking to or getting past the telephone staff is like banging your head off a brick wall!  Spanish Inquisition springs to mind! They’re just plain rude, dismissive, up their own backsides and treat you like scum as soon as legal aid is mentioned!  Yes they can do the work, but you need to pay full price as they are selective about legal aid jobs apparently…I have reported this back to Legal Aid as they are recommending lawyers for jobs based on a legal aid basis but the lawyers then want to charge you?  If the office staff behave in this manner, I’d hate to think what the lawyers are like!   In my opinion, this company has just got far too big for their boots and do not care about actually helping people! Soulless Money Making Racket!",1644064219

Neil Kilcoyne & Co Solicitors,Lee Parry,2,"Been with the company for roughly 5 years by two amazing lawyers whom worked for Mr.Kilcoyne. Sadly both lawyers left the firm for unknown reasons to myself .  Then Neil began to reprasent me , found his demeanour rude and an air off not interested ,especially in my point of view and information i believed that was imoortant to the case , first time he represented me at court due to a mix up of which court , he withdraws his representation , leaving me back to square one with my case after 5 years . Totally detrimental to my continuous  battle regarding my child . Don't recommend being represented by Mr.Kilcoyne himself.",1570793308
The Road Traffic Lawyer Glasgow,Liam Irwin,5,"My family and I can't thank Ronnie Simpson enough and would highly recommend him to anyone. I was facing points on my license after being stopped for having no insurance through an admin error. Gaining these points would have meant that losing my career as a clean license is essential. After a long 10 months of worrying, Ronnie was able to persuade the prosecution to drop the case. His skills and knowledge are second to none. He kept me fully informed and gave me sound advice throughout the process. He was very professional, friendly, and completely exceeded my expectations. First class service!!",1704650174
The Road Traffic Lawyer Glasgow,Paul Mason,5,I cannot recommend this firm highly enough.

The Road Traffic Lawyer Glasgow,Colin McMillan,5,"I recently required the services of The Road traffic Lawyer and I was assigned Ronnie.  Ronnie was transparent from the start, laid out potential outcomes and then made clear what he believed he could do.  I was facing a charge of dangerous driving which Ronnie successfully got reduced to careless driving. There was also a ridiculous charge of failing to stop for a police officer that Ronnie got thrown out also.  I was kept up to date throughout this and on my court day I was given the smallest penalty possible again thanks to Ronnie.  This firm came highly recommended and I can now first hand see why that’s the case. If you need a traffic lawyer stop searching as this is the one.",1705408910

The Road Traffic Lawyer Glasgow,Innes McLellan,5,"I have used the firm previously and was highly impressed with the astute Michael Lyon who handled my case back then.  Unfortunately, all these years later I found myself receiving a citation from the court with several alleged offences.  My case called early on the 22nd December @ Dumfries JP Court. The expert and highly tenacious Ronnie Simpson was my solicitor on the day. It quickly became apparent that we were in for a joke of a day. Ronnie was not impressed with the Crown in the slightest for their handling of the case as they informed him of their wish to adjourn for a date sometime next year. I recall him asserting that he was going to “nail the Crown” - and nail them he did! Ronnie was unwavering - he vehemently opposed an adjournment and he showed strength & guile in the face of the Crown as they wished to adjourn my case for a later date as the Police Witnesses seemingly failed to turn up. Ronnie put his foot down and laid out a comprehensive argument for the case to be abandoned as it surely wasn’t in the public interest for it to continue.  I am absolutely delighted to announce that the case was indeed abandoned. A most welcome early Christmas present! I hope Ronnie & the rest of the Michael Lyon team have a fantastic Christmas & New Year. Of course, I hope that I don’t require their services again in the future, however I wouldn’t hesitate to get in contact as their skills and expertise are second to none. They are the best for a reason.",1703257440

Friends Legal,Mark Robertson,1,"Absolutely terrible experience with this company. I got in contact with them for help with winding up my late Mum's estate. They were very quick to provide me with a fee and their Terms of Business but after that, communication was absolutely terrible.  I received an email from one of the assistant's asking me to 'send all the documentation' to allow them to proceed. I followed up asking specifically what documentation they required, only to receive a fairly cryptic response. I then replied asking if they could let me know exactly what they need from me and up to this point have had no response.  I got fed up and contacted a local Solicitor who in contrast, was absolutely excellent. Within a 10 minute conversation he'd advised exactly hat I had to do and even told me what I could do myself to minimise the fee to be paid to him.  My advice would be not to bother with Friends Legal. Speak to you local Solicitor instead who will actually communicate with you, rather than leave a clueless admin person to try and relay 2nd hand information.",1663754936

Nero Legal,K R,2,"Overview: -	Do NOT believe their ‘lower than others’ quotes, it’s just because they leave things out of the quote that other firms don’t. Expect them to be similar priced or more expensive than more honest quotes from competitors. -	Their communication was mediocre at best -	They charged for things they did not deliver -	2/5 not 1/5 because everything did actually work out… so far.  False quotes I used Nero Legal for a property purchase at auction this year. I saw a review before hand warning that they’re only “cheaper” in online quotes because they leave essential things out of the quote. I should have taken that on board – because here’s what happened.  In my initial call following an online quote (which mentioned the property was an auction), I made it very clear the property was being bought at auction in the call. Wary of the review that had said they hike quotes once you’ve agreed to it, I explicitly asked the employee if there were other fees that were likely to be added to the quote. She said, slightly annoyed tone, “we can’t possibly know that because we haven’t started investigating the case yet”. I agree to go ahead.  I jump through the hoops of sending off ID, statements etc., give the auction house Nero’s details, and in general commit precious time (only have 28 days to complete post-auction) waiting for the gears to turn, so can’t back out now.  Well what do you know, a week or two later it turns out that Nero charge a flat £120 fee to handle auction purchases. Am I seriously to believe that the relatively senior employee who I spoke to on the phone, who handled my quote and specified the amount, who very explicitly knew that the property was being bought at auction… am I to believe she didn’t know Nero charge a flat fee for auctions when I asked her if other fees would be added? Did she not know, or did she lie?  Communication In general, speaking to Nero is a waiting game, punctuated by repeated ‘out of office’ replies as employees handling your time-critical case go on annual leave (which is certainly fair) with no notice whatsoever to us, even the day before, with time-critical exchanges and work ongoing (which is not certainly not fair). This happened on at least 2 occasions.  Also, critical things such as “what steps are actually required” and “how long do different parts of the process take” and “what do you need from me” were never communicated until the absolute last minute. We had to scramble at almost every turn to keep up with our completion deadline because we’d learn from Nero that something else was required and find it usually takes days or weeks to get.  Charging for things FYI, if you pay £24+VAT for a copy of the title deeds after purchase, they just won’t bother to send them to you. But the purchase worked out in the end… so far. I have very little faith in their due diligence, so I just have to hope for the best.",1702128013

David Kinloch & Co,Sarah McCaw,5,"I  contacted David Kinloch & Co after my son was caught speeding by a mobile speed camera. He had been driving for less than 2 years and already had 3 points on his licence meaning his licence would be revoked and he would have to return to learner driver status. There were extreme personal circumstances surrounding the point at which he was caught speeding. I spoke to Ross Jenkins and from the moment I spoke to him I felt better. He was calm and helpful and above all incredibly sympathetic to the situation that my family were dealing with. He took on our case and dealt with the fiscal to explain the circumstances surrounding the offence. He managed to get the offence downgraded to a warning meaning my son could keep his licence - something we hardly dared to believe could happen. This had been hanging over my son at a time that was already very difficult and this has been like a weight has been lifted off us. I cannot thank Ross enough. His professional, calm and understanding approach made this whole process easier for us and we will be forever grateful for his help in resolving things for us.

I was accused of 2 charges (driving and assault) which neither were the truth, putting a huge amount of stress and strain hanging over us all for 2 years until today.  From the very beginning, Ross was very professional and dignified, worked hard for us keeping us updated on all about the case and explaining how the process works all the way through.  I must highlight the appreciation we have on how Ross handled the what must have been difficult task of talking and explaining to my daughter who was a witness, 8 years old at the start of this accusation, on what would happen and calming her emotions and nerves in the whole process. Luckily and due to the work Ross done today during the COPFS witness's stand, my daughter did not have to take the stand, and neither did myself or the other defense witness as all charges were dropped before the need and I was free to go without charge. I would highly recommend Ross. Great and easy to work with, highly efficient and helpful. Thanks Ross.",1653506514

BTO Solicitors LLP,Ian McKelvie,1,"Very unprofessional and disappointing.  After being the family's solicitor of choice for decades I didn't even consider looking elsewhere when we needed help appointing an executor and dealing with a very simple will. How wrong could I be?  It took them nearly 14 months, cost over £4000 and during the process my emails would often go unanswered for weeks on end and on two occasions I discovered the reason was that the person assigned to my case had left the company, and it wasn't until I repeatedly contacted them that someone new was in touch. It took a complaint to one of the senior partners to gee them into action, otherwise I'd probably still be waiting. At the time of writing this I still haven't received any form of final receipt from them, or even a simple acknowledgement that our business has been concluded. I won't be using them again.",1677966865

Karen, at the office was always pleasant, easy to talk to, and quick to pass on information. Richard is as sharp as a new tack. He picked up on several issues in the case. He went in fighting from the moment he took the case, he fought for me even up to walking into court for trial, the PF was pushing back hard for some reason. Richard did not give in, and was still fighting as we stood in front of the Sheriff. I accepted a plea of Careless Driving, that Richard fought to get for me.

Complete Clarity Solicitors,Abdoulaye B,1,"This review has been in my mind for quite sometime,  so here we go.. I do not recommend using Complete Clarity Solicitors for your legal needs. Last year I contracted them to handle an eviction case and was quoted £700 upfront. This ended up being a major bait and switch.  A trainee solicitor was assigned to my case and charged overall £3000 just to read through the tenancy agreement and issue templated notices to the tenant. I was never informed a trainee would be handling my case and that costs would skyrocket so quickly.  The initial quote of £700 was completely misleading. Within days, Complete Clarity was aggressively chasing me for payment as the bill escalated out of control. Their greed was astounding.  At times, I found the firm very difficult to work with. Communication was poor and I was unable to get clear answers on mounting costs. We were lured in with lowball quotes and then they let a trainee run up the bills.  We ended up paying little over £4000. I deeply regret using them for my eviction case and advise looking elsewhere for legal services.",1690923936

Fredrick & Co. Glasgow Solicitors,Simon Boyle,1,"Honestly a waste of time engaging then for any property related services. Had to chase them to get a quote for their services to have them argue it was sent in the pdf in the first email (it wasn't). To have to wait 6 days after closing for a response from them. And yes they had to be chased for that too. The response ""oh the estate agent has spoken to you already"". Legitimately the exact response sent after waiting that length of time after closing. For a lawyer this is entirely unacceptable and would result in people losing out on a property they otherwise could have closed. Avoid! Emails saved as proof should anyone want to dispute the above.",1696842871

Writing this review seems like the closure I need. HE IS VERY NEGLIGENT! At a point, it was as if he was doing me a favour for services he was being paid for. I was the one chasing after him, he won't return calls, he won't even keep to his appointment when he makes one with you, it became very obvious at some point that he hadn't even gone through my file to understand my case. My frustration tripled, and I had to start visiting his office without any appointment just to be able to access him. Words are not able to capture my huge disappointment in his service. His poor service affected a part of the process that I now have to live with. DMO OLABAMIJI, you have a lot of improving  to do.

Mitchells Roberton Solicitors,Lisa Mulhern,1,"They took on a case and raised a Simple Procedure claim against my paraplegic, pensioner dad and breast cancer suffering mum, for a case which was, at the time, already sitting with the Sheriff Court awaiting the case to be heard, with no judgement given. They have no duty to check for existing cases, that would be an extra courtesy.  As a layperson, how are we meant to know you can't have 2 court cases raised for the same transaction? Unless we seek legal advice? No,  what happens is you terrify disabled pensioners into completing and submitting MORE unnecessary paperwork just to harass them.  After being informed by the court that their case was a duplicate, they rescinded the case. But they didn't tell us. It would be an extra courtesy for them to inform us that they had cancelled the case.  The company directors ultimately trying to extort money out of us, upvcwindowsscotland (Web site now removed thankfully) are in jail awaiting 39 charges of fraud. Your client, Redwood Collections, are liars and thieves. They were told about the existing court case immediately on receipt of their letter. If they told you otherwise, maybe you need more robust procedures to ensure your clients don't make incompetent liars out of you.  So, if you're looking for legal representation with the minimum of questions asked and no courtesy provided, Mitchells Roberton are the firm for you.",1673782557

I am 10000% satisfied from his legal service and would always recommend him for any one who is stuck in any sort of immigration matter.

Most companies weren't local either but happy to know they were city centre based. I went with Quinn Martin and Langan because it was most affordable and local; which meant my experience would be personal instead of online.

Gilson Gray LLP,Gareth,1,"Very unhappy with Gilson Grey. I poured 50k into their pockets and when I got into financial difficulty and couldn't pay 1 invoice in full they dropped me like a hot potato causing me a lot of grief in court. They refused a payment plan and are threatening to make me bankrupt if I don't pay in full. No humanity, just want to hear if I can pay in full. Check their billing before deciding to hire them. It was £49+ vat per email (read, reply, read and send = £196+vat per communication with the other side). I was also charged £16.50 per text message (read or send) and was encouraged to communicate this way for small questions. A few times I queried the bill and it came down several hundred pounds. Before Gilson Grey want to argue this I am happy to post screenshots with relevant info redacted to prove my claim. They were poor in communication and in keeping me up to date. I had to chase and was charged for the privilege. They didn't do half of what I asked of them for court. They just did the bare minimum for £265+vat per hour. My new lawyer in contrast, keeps me up to date, listens to me and has put forward what I have asked and has already made a drastic change to my case. My advice is look elsewhere.",1700051929
Gilson Gray LLP,Giulia Lunardi,2,"My broker recommended them but I wouldn't do the same. They completely failed to keep me up to date on the progresses of my purchase, knowing I was a first time buyer and needed lots of reassurance and information. Just two weeks before my moving date, and no updates, I had to call the office to be told the person who was dealing with my purchase was on holiday. They didn't do anything to ease the process of buying a flat.",1691143971
Gilson Gray LLP,S. S.,1,"AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. Super terrible service. If you’re looking for overpriced solicitors that ghost you and do not follow through, this is the perfect place! This case got escalated to senior management at Gilson Gray and to First Mortgage (who promised they would never refer anyone else to Gilson Gray after what happened to me). Here’s what happened: Chloe Armstrong made an offer on my behalf on a property on Thursday 28th of July 2022, and then I sent her an email on Friday 29th asking for an update on the offer. Radio silence. I then called on Monday August 1st. Again radio silence. So I left a voice mail asking for updates on the property. Radio silence once again. I never received a call or email from Chloe telling me that the offer had been accepted. I called Gilson Gray on Wednesday 3rd of August and I asked to speak to someone else apart from Chloe since I could not get a hold of her. The secretary let me speak to Nathalie, who revealed to me that my offer had already been accepted. Nathalie apologised for Chloe’s behaviour and I asked to file a formal complaint against Chloe (but Nathalie was against it and wanted to speak to Chloe’s manager first). Nathalie then told me that there was nothing that I had to do at that point as the anti money laundering checks were being done that day for me and that I would have received a call either later that day (Wednesday 3rd) or the following day at max (Thursday 4th). I never received that call. I call again a few days later and I discover that the AML checks had apparently been submitted for review only on Monday 8th of August. Then a lady called Victoria takes on my case. I called Victoria on the 13th of September and that day she told me she would send me a document and some links through email the following day. She never did. I called her again on the 20th and she told me that she would send me a document and some links via email. Again no email. I called her again on 22nd September and she told me that the document was not ready and she asked me what the progress on my mortgage offer was (the mortgage offer had been waiting there from the 6th September). So I lost a lot of time. All of this was escalated to senior management at Gilson Gray and Melissa took over the case. She did a superb job in a timely manner. It is a shame that it had to get to that point. Please stay away from these solicitors.",1689710130

They kept on ""asking"" if I had any acoustic disorders despite me repeatedly explaining the technical difficulties – zero respect for others and borderline discriminatory behaviour. They wrote me a follow-up email to give a ""summary"" loaded with falsehood. I corrected them and they have ghosted me ever since.

Thankfully the incompetence showed early on and I hadn't wasted anymore time waiting on not hearing back from a solicitor.  I've booked consultations elsewhere without any issue. It took only a few minutes and seemed relatively easy for an appointment to be made. Maybe this concept of booking appointments for consultations is something that the receptionist and law firm could learn how to manage.  An appointment system would seem like a good practice to have, and also returning calls is a practical solution in keeping potential clients.",1696506927

Paperwork then handed personally by myself to the receptionist on 4th October and said paperwork still not been sent to court.  Hannah Hares has now left the company, I was not informed of this and had to keep phoning to find out who was taking over my case.    Trying to contact them is a nightmare.

Gilson Gray LLP,David Carruthers,1,"My experience as a landlord with Gilson Gray letting has been very poor unfortunately. They let a property for me in Edinburgh for several years. The communication was always patchy at best with emails not being replied to and phone calls going unreturned being the norm. This improved briefly when the account was handled by Katy but unfortunately it returned to its inadequate level when she left in December 22. I sold this flat through Gilson Grey Estate Agency, they were fine. It was agreed that Gilson Gray letting would forward all correspondence relating to council tax, utilities and so on and I would deal with it. Unfortunately, they have not done so and I now have penalties of around £252.12 and 2 summary warrants that I know of. I have tried to contact them multiple times over the last couple of weeks to discuss but nobody is ever available on the phone, the calls are never returned, and emails are never responded to. It is incredibly frustrating. The letting side of this business is not run to a professional standard and if you are a landlord considering engaging them as an agent I would look elsewhere. I write this review partially out of desperation in the hope it will prompt Gilson Gray to respond to my previous attempts at contact, I am not hopeful.",1692860891

BCKM Solicitors,Fabulously Wealthy,1,"Posting anonymously. What a useless law firm. Mild mannered, gentle, kind. Not the qualities you want in a solicitor which I think are aggressive, follow every possibility, prepare and strategise. Instead they fobbed me off on a trainee for ages who was doubly useless and out of her depth, but then when one of the senior partners took over he wasn't much better. I don't know the law but I'm reasonably intelligent and read up as much as I could on my situation, suggesting certain avenues to the partner - he treated my ideas with a patronising contempt and THEN on court day when his way wasn't working tried my ideas. But he'd lost too much ground by then and I was found guilty. Never met such a passive, unassuming legal firm. If you want ""nice"" and ""friendly"" BCKM are for you; if you want to WIN, go somewhere else.",1684563248

McSporrans Defence Lawyers,Douglas Dunbar,5,"Almost one year ago, I was unfortunate enough to be charged with 3 criminal offences. As someone who had not previously had dealings with the Court system or the Police in that context, it was a confusing and worrying time for both me and my family. I asked around my professional friends to recommend a competent and experienced criminal lawyer and McSporrans  name came up on several occasions. My case had various complications such as vulnerable witness applications and was not straightforward in many respects. Nobody can guarantee the outcome in court proceedings but I have to say that throughout the whole process, Andrew Houston, of McSporrans guided me, explained the various stages and provided me with a frank and honest appraisal of what to expect and our best course of action. Andrew is a consummate professional and I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending his services to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation as me. It was not just his command of the legal processes and knowledge of the law which impressed me. It is clear that he is well respected within the system and his courteous manner goes a long way to find agreement, consensus and common sense within the system.

Good & Stewart Solicitors,harry gaden,2,"Communication before the trial was awful. Never did Mr Good get in touch with me first, even when dates had clearly changed, it was not brought to my attention and when I did desperately reach out I was almost always answered days later. I was told with me having to wait almost 18 months for my trial date that it gave us plenty of time to build a really strong case. However, it never felt like we took the time to do this, he scribbled down what had happened when I first ever met him and then never again did we go over it. With Mr Good having my only fresh account of the night, I relied on it being typed up in full for me to go over ready for the day of the trial, sadly all I had was some second hand drafted notes with lots of details missing. Mr Goods’ efforts on the day I cannot overly fault, despite the outcome not being as desired, he did appear to try. I am not one to ever give bad reviews, but I want it to be made clear that if you feel you may require a higher level of care, reassurance or updates, then Mr Good unfortunately is not your man.",1693160959

Neither of these lawyers will stand up for your rights as they are far more concerned with their “good” standing within the court and with the judges… John is good friends with the judge i had , so John told me himself after losing my trial.  If you want a lawyer that will actually fight your corner and do a real legal defence i would look outside of Edinburgh as the lawyers here are all the same… they won’t even file appeals for you as they do not want the reputation of Ruffling feathers or going against the court or status quo.

ELP Arbuthnott McClanachan Solicitors & Estate Agents,Marg Rothwell,1,Tried to make an appointment with these solicitors but was fobbed off for a week. Phoned back a week later and was told by the same person wait a month. No explanation. Seems as Ms Watson has retired and they haven’t a replacement as yet. The person on the phone could have explained. My friend who sold her house through these solicitors asked me to use them. I am sure this post will be deleted.,1706525759

ELP Arbuthnott McClanachan Solicitors & Estate Agents,Alan Chapman,5,"At the end of lockdown, I (like most others it seemed) decided it would be a good time to try and get onto the property ladder. After various 'automated' quotes from a few bigger solicitor/estate agency companies, it was refreshing to get a personalised email quote from Irene at ELP. Fast forward a year almost later, various notes of interest, a couple of offers and one was finally accepted! (I didn't get it the first time, but the successful offer fell through a few months later, and the selling agent contacted me to see if I was still interested). Irene handled the whole process efficiently, and was excellent (and very patient) at answering all my first time buyer questions (no matter how trivial), and even when there were delays with the mortgage due to complications on the title deeds she explained everything to me so my mind was at ease. Near the end, the transaction was handed over to Catherine and Sharon while Irene was on annual leave, the whole process was smooth and hassle free, from my offering being accepted to having the keys within 8 weeks. I will definitely be using elp in the future for any soliciting needs. Thankyou for everything! Alan",1650274947

Despite the fact my claim could not be progressed, Kirsty advised me in detail about the legal position, so I was left feeling that we had explored all the options and a well-informed decision not to proceed had been made.

When I first spoke to my assigned solicitor Kirsty Lang she took an extended period to go over my full case with me in a way to ensure I had a very clear understanding of my situation.  Thought my almost 2 years of Kirsty representing me she has been consistent in how informed she has kept me though the whole process, explaining information in a clear and concise way for me to understand and above all she has managed my expectation through our journey instead of making promisees she could not keep.  All of this is before getting onto how friendly and engaging she has been making the whole process more calm and informal removing a lot of the stress.

Sinclairs Criminal Defense Lawyer,King ofdubb,1,"Very disappointing. I am surprised at all the good reviews on here, but as none are verified, I can only surmise that most, if not all have been fabricated.  I was informed that Sinclairs consists of 2 lawyers, and the one assigned to me was Mr Moore.  Apart from being very short, and unfriendly with me over the phone, he would not discuss my case with me prior to my hearing either by phone, letter, email, or in person, but did say he would advise me at court before the hearing commenced. I was waiting for him at the court, outside of the courtroom, for him to call for, or approach me, from before 10am when the hearings in the court rooms started.  Eventually a man came out of the court room, called my name, and immediately went back inside the court room.  I followed him in, and it was not until the proceedings started, and the same man stood up and pleaded ""not Guilty"" on my behalf that I became aware that he was Mr Moore - my appointed solicitor.  He had offered the plea to the judge without consulting me, or even introducing himself to me.  I had already decided to plead guilty, unless Mr Moore was able to convince me that it would be in my best interests to plead not guilty.  I had to interrupt the proceedings to make it clear to the judge that Mr Moore had not consulted me, and that I wished to plead guilty.  What a waste of time & effort in engaging with Mr Moore and Sinclairs.  In my opinion, I don't believe he should be practicing Law, if he can't treat his clients with basic respect.",1702544400

TC Young Solicitors,Gem_ ini,1,"Would NOT recommend. I used to find my lawyer was fantastic here, very sympathetic and efficient, however in a real time of need I asked for some urgent assistance which was just for my lawyer to send me an email on my behalf and I got a very rude and abrupt response from the Partner of the company. He said he would not send the email and gave me no explanation whatsoever. There wasn’t anything untoward or different about my email request so I was very confused and upset that they have such an unsympathetic response. I asked why they weren’t going to give legal representation and all they said was that my lawyer was ‘unavailable’ and that my case had been closed and nobody else at the firm had the capacity to help me. It was so odd and unprofessional. It made me feel as if I’d done something wrong when I just asked for some legal assistance. It turns out my lawyer had left the company, but they didn’t have the courtesy to tell me this, nor did they tell me my case had been closed which would have been a courteous thing to do. I now have no lawyer who knows my background and have to find another firm and start all over again. Awful.",1703237920

Watermans,Jack Janas,5,"Mr. Johnny Richardson, Claims Manager from Watermans, branch in Edinburgh, successfully handled my case for compensation for loss of health as a result of a seemingly minor road accident. First of all, Mr. Richardson sent me for non-invasive medical consultation. And my car was quickly and efficiently repaired, the original front bumper was replaced in place of the crushed one. Our contact was via the Internet, only at the beginning I had to come to the Watermans office with the documentation necessary to conduct the case. The customer service at Watermans is worth recommending! Not only was I met with great kindness and patience, but also with professionalism, which is always beneficial in situations of conflict of interests - the injured party and the perpetrator's insurer. What is very important is the way the legal services were settled: Watermans simply deducted 20% from the compensation won and sent the remaining 80% of the compensation to my bank account. I must admit that this is a very convenient, non-stressful way of dealing with a law firm. - I would like to thank Mr. Johnny Richardson for taking on this case and for the final result, very positive for me, in the form of winning the case.",1703418066

This was due to Aileen’s friendly and approachable manner meaning I could ask any questions I had even when I thought they were silly. I can’t speak highly enough of her professionalism and efficiency, she was always on hand to provide me with guidance and updates, and I never felt alone in the process. Aileen’s knowledge and experience was amazing and helped me to get on the ladder far quicker than I anticipated at a time when it has been difficult for first time buyers.

Thompsons Personal Injury Solicitors,Laila Dunbar,5,"Oops, accidentally said this place never contacted me again after first call, that was NOT this place. This place actually did reply to my email pretty quickly to say sorry to hear about my situation but that unfortunately it wasn't something they deal with. So I don't really have any proper experience with them but at least them got back to me and seemed nice so giving 5 stars based on that :)",1666789201
Thompsons Personal Injury Solicitors,Agnieszka Cz,1,"Really bad experience mainly due to communications. I am quite surprised to read the earlier reviews because I had totally opposite experience.  I think the major issue was that in the middle of the case the lawyer who led my case resign. No one send me any communications about it. In only found not because I did not hear from them for a while, so I send an email asking for updates. I received a bounce message about the fact that she left.  At the beginning, Thompsons has lost my documents because at first I was transferred from Glasgow to Edinburgh. I left in notes that I have special requirements, and they never respected that, I had to remind about it several times.  And now upon completion of the case, things still did not improve. I was inquiring about the possibility of using a personal injury trust for depositing the money. The answer was to wait. So I did, for far too long, that the cheque I was sent lots its due date. I send a message about what to do about it- with no response. It is honestly a very difficult company to deal with, and although the solicitor argued the case, communications throughout were terrible.",1558481504
Thompsons Personal Injury Solicitors,Sara Ally,1,"If I could have gave no stars that would been more accurate.  This place is a joke.  Between one of the receptionists bad attitude, poor phone manner and inability to do her job to the solicitors who sit on your case for over a yr and dont do any work on it then leave and take with them any notes on your case.  My friend has been waiting 2 yrs on a claim she has in and so far in the 2yrs all they have managed to do is collect the details from her twice about what happened.  Theyve never managed to progress from here.  Everytime she calls to speak with the solicitor dealing with her claim shes either unavailable and they dont know when she'll be back or shes out at lunch.  Sounds like a cushy number for the solicitors but if as a client you expect them to actually do any work on your case look elsewhere.",1552134628
Thompsons Personal Injury Solicitors,Abawbag boarding,1,"I would avoid this firm at all costs . Lawyer paid to cover a settlement agreement and takes less than 8 mins . Uses a witness who wasn't present. Hand written notes as evidence . The Scottish law society just marks it up as "" the solicitor’s misdemeanour is more by its nature evidence of a casual and sloppy approach to the Settlement Agreement’s "" This is the kind of effort you can expect",1572514217
Thompsons Personal Injury Solicitors,E&A Cousins,1,No communication phone calls sent to Marie voicemail left a few messages but no return calls very disappointing,1659362367

My Probate Partner,Arlene,5,"This is a great and trustworthy service.  I had attempted to apply for confirmation on my own, using information from government websites.  This was useless and wasted time.  I then found My Probate Partner, online and after an initial call with Mike I decided to use their service.

I'm delighted to say that my first application was successful, thanks to My Probate Partner.  I'd thoroughly recommend using them.",1696686159
My Probate Partner,Sue Ritchie,5,"I was getting really stressed trying to fill out the C1 form for my dad. His affairs were really simple and I didn't think justified paying a solicitor almost £4,000 to do. Thank goodness I found My Probate Partner online! Mike was so helpful and supportive, and with the templates and samples I had access to I was able to get the form completed without further stress.",1701177025
My Probate Partner,Paul Cook,5,An excellent service was provided all round. The guides were clear and easy to follow for completing the forms and using the correct legalese. The check of the form picked up a few small but potentially crucial errors that I had made and emails sent to Mike were replied to quickly. Confirmation was granted first time with no issues and without the expense of a solicitor. I would recommend the service for anyone applying for confirmation/probate.,1697470597
My Probate Partner,Jacqueline G,4,"Excellent service and finally received confirmation.  However, very expensive. Although I'm aware solicitors charge so much more.. I do think the price should be graded on the complexity of the estate etc.  Mine was fairly straight forward having 2 properties to include and I don't think there  was alot of work involved.  Of course guidance is essential as application for confirmation is so complicated. I found it difficult to understand all the instructions given - maybe that's just me - so had to pay a further £300 for the forms to be filled in for me.  Pleased it's finally been accepted. A further £297 had to be paid to the Sheriffs court.. An expensive business!",1702128928
My Probate Partner,Carol Cook,5,"Highly, highly recommend this service. Mike was fantastic and made the whole process straightforward. He was incredibly fast and helpful answering questions by email and followed up to check everything went well with the filing. Confirmation went through first time. Could not have been better.",1700342702

Scottish Child Law Centre,Chas,5,Great help and advice. Used them a couple of times now. Yes they can take their time to get back to you but as it's free and as they specialise in children and helping them they can be very busy and as it is really the only one in Scotland it is worth the wait. If you want immediate help them go pay for it but don't criticize a free service for being busy as they are helping other children. I have waited up to 3 weeks for a call back but they have always contacted me when they say they would.,1537718337

Cath Karlin Family Law,Fiona Mackay,5,"From the first phone call  - to find out where to start the process of separation - I knew I was in good hands. I wanted a collaborative approach and she guided me through the collaborative and not-so-collaborative process with empathy, knowledge and support. She provided us both with excellent financial and counselling support professionals as part of the collaboration and kept me calm when it felt like the world was falling apart There were tears, there were meltdowns (me - not her!) but there were also some laughs and this made the horrible process of divorce just that bit easier to bear. A divorce is possibly the hardest emotional rollercoaster one will ever encounter - and people like Cath Karlin are essential to get through it. I would have no hesitation in recommending her should any of my friends ever find themselves in need of a good family lawyer.",1600359329
